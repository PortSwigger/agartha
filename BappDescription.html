<p>Agartha creates payloads to reveal injection flaws, generates user request/response tables to spot access violations, and converts Http requests to JavaScript code for further XSS exploitation.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Payload Generator' creates dynamic, systematic and vendor-neutral payloads/wordlists for LFI, RCE and SQLi attacks with many different possibilities and bypassing methods, against various platforms and applications to help finding injections flaws.</li>
	<li>'Authorization Matrix' generates user access table based on 'User Sessions X URLs', which makes easy to find access violations and authentication/authorization issues. Also 'SiteMap' feature can crawl all links automatically the user can visit.</li>
	<li>'Copy as JavaScript' converts Http requests to JavaScript code for digging up XSS issues and more.</li>
</ul>
